Syntax| Syntax, in computer science, refers to the spelling and grammar of a programming language. Computers are inflexible machines that understand what you type only if you type it in the exact form or sytax that the computer expects. Each program defines its own syntactical rules that control which words the computer understands, which combinations of words are meaningful, and what punctuation is necessary. The analysis of a program's syntax is usually performed using an automatically generated program known as a parser which often builds an abstract syntax tree.|labautopedia| http://www.labautopedia.org/mw/List_of_programming_and_computer_science_terms#T
Static Library| In computer science, a static library, also referred to as a statically linked library, is a computer library in which links are resolved at compile-time by a linker.

Source Code| Source code, just called source or code, is any series of statements written in some high level computer programming language. The term is typically used in the context of a particular piece of computer software. A computer program's source code is the collection of files that can be converted from human-readable form to an equivalent computer-executable form in machine language. The source code is either converted into an executable file by a compiler for a particular computer architecture, or executed on the fly from the human readable form with the aid of an interpreter.|labautopedia| http://www.labautopedia.org/mw/List_of_programming_and_computer_science_terms#T

Character Mapping |Character mapping refers to the process of using a table used in an operating system or font to map the character codes to the glyphs used in a font. Most character encoding uses an 8-bit system allowing a maximum of 256 character codes. Extended or non-AlphaNumeric languages often use 16-bit or Double Byte encoding. Also, Character Maps or not necessarily cross platform compatible. For example, the Macintosh and Windows operating systems use differing character maps. However, Type 1 fonts do contain the glyphs necessary for both these mappings and so work in both Macintosh and Windows systems and others.|Labautotopia|http://www.labautopedia.org/mw/List_of_programming_and_computer_science_terms
Instruction Scheduling |Instruction scheduling, in computer technologies, is a compiler optimization phase used to improve instruction-level parallelism, which improves performance on machines with instruction pipelines. Without changing the meaning of the instructions, instruction scheduling tries to: 1) avoid pipeline stalls by rearranging the order of instructions; 2) order the instructions to avoid duplicated memory access.|Labautotopia|http://www.labautopedia.org/mw/List_of_programming_and_computer_science_terms
Parallel Computing |Parallel computing is the simultaneous execution of the same task (split up and specially adapted) on multiple processors or multiple computers in order to obtain results faster. The idea is based on the fact that the process of solving a problem usually can be divided into smaller tasks, which may be carried out simultaneously with some coordination. A subtype of parallel algorithms, distributed algorithms are algorithms designed to work in cluster computing and distributed computing environments, where additional concerns beyond the scope of "classical" parallel algorithms need to be addressed..|Labautotopia|http://www.labautopedia.org/mw/List_of_programming_and_computer_science_terms

Pointer|In computer science, a pointer is a programming language object, whose value refers to (or "points to") another value stored elsewhere in the computer memory using its memory address. A pointer references a location in memory, and obtaining the value stored at that location is known as dereferencing the pointer. As an analogy, a page number in a book's index could be considered a pointer to the corresponding page; dereferencing such a pointer would be done by flipping to the page with the given page number and reading the text found on the indexed page.|Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_(computer_programming)
Char|The abbreviation char is used as a reserved keyword in a number of programming languages, such as C, C++, C#, and Java.  It is short for character, which is a data type that holds one character(letter, number, etc.) of data.

Historically, the byte was the number of bits used to encode a single character of text in a computer and for this reason it is the smallest addressable unit of memory in many computer architectures.| Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte
Bit|The bit (a portmanteau of binary digit) is a basic unit of information used in computing and digital communications. A binary digit can have only one of two values, and may be physically represented with a two-state device. These state values are most commonly represented as either a 0 or 1.|Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit
